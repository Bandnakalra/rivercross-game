# River Cross

A JavaScript implementation of the River Cross game.

A live version of it is hosted [here](http://www.vandycreations.com/syntropy/)

## Rules

The User is the only one who can pilot the boat. The boat only carries two at a time. The Zombie can never be left alone with the Civilian, or it will devour it. The Soldier also cannot be left alone with the Zombie, or it will Shoot it. Can you cross them all?

## How to play

Click on the user, Soldier, Zombie or Civilian to enter or leave the boat. Click the boat to cross the river - it'll only do it if the User is inside.
